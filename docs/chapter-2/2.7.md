# Legacy BIOS: Read from Disk into Memroy

## Int 13/AH=02h - DISK - READ SECTOR\(S\) INTO MEMORY

See below for a quick review over this function:

> AH = 02h AL = number of sectors to read \(must be nonzero\) CH = low eight bits of cylinder number CL = sector number 1-63 \(bits 0-5\) high two bits of cylinder \(bits 6-7, hard disk only\) DH = head number DL = drive number \(bit 7 set for hard disk\) ES:BX -&gt; data buffer
>
> Return: CF set on error CF clear if successful AH = status AL = number of sectors transferred \(only valid if CF set for some BIOSes\)
