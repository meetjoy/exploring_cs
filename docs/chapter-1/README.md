# First Chapter

A Linux operating system is to be used as the platform for the experiments we are going to do in this book. Please move to section 1 if you already have any distribution of Linux installed on your personal computer, it can be running on a virtual machine or alongside with Windows or macOS.

For these who do not currently have a Linux system in hand, or these who are even new to Linux system, Ubuntu desktop is recommended. Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution. It can be installed either on a virtual machine which is running on your current operating system or alongside with your current operating system. Please refer to appendix A for more information if you encounter some difficulties in installing Ubuntu desktop. It might take several hours if itâ€™s your first time to install a system. Be patient and keep searching the answers whenever something confuses you.
