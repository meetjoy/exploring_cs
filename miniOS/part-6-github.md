### Installing VirtualBox
Hi guys, in this video we are going to install VirtualBox. Firstly we search "virtualbox" in the browser, then we come to their official website. I am using Windows now, so click and download the Windows version. Now pause the video, download either the Windows version or the MacOS version for your computer.

Welcome back, now we have downloaded the installer. Click to install, .... finally click finsh. Okay, here we are, that's the hypervisor or the virtual machine manager. In the next video we are going to see how to install Ubuntu. 

### Installing Ubuntu Desktop

Hi guys, in this video we are going to install Ubuntu. Firstly search Ubuntu in the browser then we go to their offical website. Under Downloads, we click the 18.04LTS. Lts stands for the long term service version. 18.04 is the current available latest version. The file is nearly 2G, so it takes a couple of minutes. Now pause the video and do the same on your computer. 

2nd part of the video. Finish.
