Video 0 Introduction

Video 1 Write our very first program in assembly language
We learn that there is a strong correspondence between the machine code and the assembly code. Then we write our first program in assembly lanuage.

Machine code:

Video 2 GNU assembler, Linux Desktop, virtual machine & hypervisor
Introduction of assembler which is used to translate assembly code to machine code. Then gives a way on installing a Linux Desktop if you have not got one.

Video 3 Installing VirtualBox
Video 4 Installing Ubuntu Desktop on VirtualBox

Video 5 Terminal, basic Linux commands and binutils
Introduces the most commonly used linux commands. We learn that GNU assembler is part of the Binutils package.

Video 6 Assembly, object file, binary, hexadecimal, disassembly, architecture and i8086
We get a deep understanding on assembly, object file, binary, disassembly and architecture by using programs as, xxd and objdump.

Video 7 Linking, executable file or runnable, booting, POST, ROM, legacy BIOS, MBR, RAM, 0x7c00 and UEFI
We get a good understanding on linking, executable file, booting, and legacy BIOS etc..

Video 8 Installing emulator Bochs-2.6.9 on Ubuntu18.04LTS
Commands used when installing Bochs:
sudo apt install libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libx11-dev
./configure
make
sudo make install

Video 9 Run our first program using Bochs
Video 10 Explain our first assembly language line by line: Interrupt, ASCII
Video 11 Make a script file to save clicks
